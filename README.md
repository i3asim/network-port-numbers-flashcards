# network-port-numbers-flashcards

This is a small python script for the purpose of helping you with your study for the Security+ exam and any exam you want.

It takes the cards from a text file named **cards.txt** .. Right now, the file contain the port numbers for the security+ exam.

**Note**: you can change the content of the file to what ever you want but, you have to put **Colon ( : )** between the question and the answer .. 
It should look like this:


**The Question : The Answer**


The program will ask the user to pick the order that they want ..

- **Same Order:** It will display the question first then the answer the same as written in the file.  

- **Revers Order:** It will display the answer first then the question.

- **Random Order:** It will randomly display the cards so for example, it may display the question first and in the second time it may display the answer first and so on.
